It is a Time-Dependent CFD assignment where the Navier's Strokes equation and Continuity Equation are solved using the Stream Function Vorticity Method. The simulations are obtained by applying the formulation of the problem in C++.
Velocity, Pressure, Streamlines, and Vorticity Contours are predicted for Reynolds Number =100,300,500.
